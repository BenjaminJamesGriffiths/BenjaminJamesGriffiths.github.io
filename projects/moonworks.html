                    In the second year of my degree, I joined team Moonworks
                    at The University of Sheffield to design, manufacture and
                    test a small remotely operated lunar rover. This rover was
                    developed to compete at the UK Students for the Exploration
                    and Development of Space (UKSEDS) Lunar Rover competition
                    2018, held at the RAL Space centre in Oxford.

                    The rover was limited to a weight of 5kg, and had to fit
                within a 30cm cube, whilst be capable of travelling over
                a simulated rocky lunar terrain, with loose sand and large
                obstacles. The mission to complete at the competition was
                to drive into a crater, collect as much dry ice samples
                as possible, and return to base.

                On the day of the competition, the entire rover was also
                subjected to vibration testing on a test bed at the space
                centre to prove that it would able to survive the violent
                forces involved with rocket launches.

                My contribution towards the project was the design of the
                obotic arm, responsible for picking up dry ice samples and
                moving them inside the rover’s sample containment area. I
                also developed an Android control application, that could
                connect to the rover via Bluetooth to control the locomotion
                system and the robot arm.
