                    I’ve always found that learning by doing is the most effective approach for learning a new skill,
                    and that’s exactly what this project was all about. After being introduced to CAD, in particular,
                    Autodesk Fusion 360 during project Moonworks, I realised that I wanted to learn more and get the
                    chance to manufacture my own designs. I also have an interest in robotics, so I thought a good
                    project to learn Fusion 360 with would be to design my own desktop sized robot arm.

                    From the very start, I knew that I wanted a design where the arms end effector would stay at the
                    same angle, no matter the position of the other axes – similar to commercial robots that are often
                    used to picking and placing objects onto pallets. This meant using parallelograms for the lower and
                    upper sections of the arm, where a series or rods that are fixed to the base and the arms joints
                    connect to the end effector, controlling its rotation.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    For powering the joints, I wanted to use NEMA 17 stepper motors as they were readily available and
                    cheap. However, they can’t produce nearly enough torque to operate the arm axes, so a form of gear
                    reduction was required. I had two option I wanted to explore, using either a belt and pulley system,
                    or a planetary gear box. Initially, I started my design using belts and pulleys as the backlash in
                    planetary gearboxes are quite significant, and I wanted my arm to have at least a suitable level of
                    accuracy and repeatability.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    However, the largest gear ratio I could achieve without using insanely large gears was 3.75, which
                    after mounting to a test jig, was still incapable of producing enough torque. Instead, I ordered
                    NEMA 17 stepper motors with a 50:1 planetary gear box attached onto the shaft, which could produce
                    enough torque to support a decent payload being picked up by the arm, and was compact in design.
                    There was some noticeable backlash, but with the arm spending most of its time leaning forward with
                    the weight of the payload, gravity would be constantly loading the gearbox anyway, so the backlash
                    wouldn’t be much of an issue. After a few design iterations, I ended up using 2x geared stepper
                    motors for the lower and upper arm sections, but kept the belt and pulley system for the base
                    rotation, as the torque required is much less.

                    For the base rotation, I used a low-cost Lazy Susan bearing, which are typically used for rotating
                    table tops and displays, but are much cheaper than slew rings. Using this bearing was essential to
                    handle the high moment loads that the arm would experience when fully extended. Conveniently, the
                    bearing also had mounting holes on both in the inner and outer sections, meaning I could simply bolt
                    one half of the bearing to the base plate, and the other half to the robot arm.

                    The lower arm section was directly connected to the shaft of one of the motors, whereas the upper
                    section was connected via an extended linkage to the shaft of the other motor. All the joints were
                    connected using steel shafts and ball bearings. The two side panels of each arm section were secured
                    together using threaded spacers, which made massive improvements to the arm rigidity and stiffness –
                    although it somewhat limited the range of motion of each axis.

                    With the arm more or less fully designed in CAD, I exported the pieces as DXF files, and laser cut
                    them out of 5mm black acrylic. The different pieces were then glued or bolted together where
                    necessary, and the motors were bolted on with accompanying mounting hardware.

                    With the robot arm built, I needed a way to power the stepper motors and control the arms movement.
                    To operate the motors, I chose to use the popular DRV8825 stepper driver (widely used for 3D
                    printers), which supports a range of operating voltages and micro-stepping configurations. To
                    control these drivers, I used an Arduino Nano, with GRBL installed, an open source high performance
                    G-Code parser. Using GRBL allowed me to simply send the Arduino a desired XYZ coordinate, and GRBL
                    would handle sending the appropriate number of pulses to the stepper drivers to move each motor the
                    correct number of steps. To send g-code commands to the Arduino running GRBL, I used Universal
                    G-Code Sender, a desktop application that allowed me to move the arm in increments to its desired
                    position, save the co-ordinates, then move it to the next position, save again etc. I could then
                    play back the saved position sequence and watch the arm perform the pre-programmed movements
                    repeatedly.
