                    In the first semester of my third year at university, I was accepted into the Sir William Siemens
                    Challenge, which is organised by the Siemens talent acquisition team, and is hosted in the iForge,
                    the university’s student makerspace. The challenge is spread across 3 days, and involves being put
                    into a multidisciplinary engineering team with students from other universities around the country.

                    The challenge we faced was to design, manufacture and present a system capable of displaying data
                    captured by the Siemens MindSphere technology installed around the Faculty of Engineering’s Diamond
                    building in a creative and innovate way. This data included readings from temperature, Co2, noise,
                    humidity and population sensors.

                    A couple of weeks before the event, we were introduced to our team and were able to start
                    communicating ideas and coming up with a plan for the challenge. We decided that we wanted to design
                    and build an ambitious marble run, where the data could be represented by factors such as the paths
                    the marbles took, how frequently the marbles are returned to the start of the run etc.
                </p>

            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    I was responsible for designing the marble run elevation system and the track in CAD, ensuring that
                    it can be manufactured using the tools and equipment the iForge has, and using the materials that
                    are available. The first hurdle to overcome was to design an elevation system that could repeatedly
                    take marbles back to the top of the track. Initial ideas were based around a pulley system which
                    used a belt with platforms attached at regular intervals for the marbles to sit on. However, we
                    realised pretty early on that it was not a design that could be easily or reliably produced in the
                    time we had, so I came up with a simple, easy to manufacture elevation system.

                    My elevator design contained a fixed chute for the marble to travel up, and a rotating blade that
                    pushed the marbles up the chute. By ending the marble run at the base of the chute, the marbles
                    could autonomously circulate round the track, and the frequency of marbles could be controlled by
                    the speed of the rotating blade. The first design of the elevation system worked most of the time,
                    but would occasionally stall the motor as the turbine blades contacted the marbles at quite a steep
                    angle. To improve the design, the first half of the chute was modified with a curved profile so that
                    the marble was gradually pushed in the upwards direction, reducing the stress on the motor.

                    Other parts of the marble run were then designed, such as a cool spiral track using clear tubing,
                    with a continuous string of NeoPixel LEDs to generate some cool lighting animations. At the top of
                    the chute, a splitter was designed to guide the incoming marbles in two different directions, using
                    a servo motor that could shut off one lane at a time. The marbles could either be directed down the
                    spiral tubing, or onto a series of straight acrylic tracks. The first part of the acrylic track had
                    a series of solenoids, that would randomly fire, potentially pushing marble onto the track below – a
                    feature that was supposed to represent the noise around the diamond (as the solenoids were very
                    loud). Both the spiral and straight track combined at the bottom of the marble run, into a funnel
                    that stored the marbles and fed them individually back into the elevator chute.
                </p>

            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    All the electromechanical devices and the LEDs were controlled using a Teensy 3 microcontroller,
                    which was programmed in the Arduino environment. All the electronics were soldered onto a sheet of
                    vero board, which was stored under the base of the marble run.

                <p>
                    Most of the parts were manufactured using the iForge laser cutters, which meant the final system
                    fitted together exactly as design in CAD. The main frame of the marble run was made using maker
                    beam, which was provided in the kit, and the rest of the items were either bolted together or glued.

                    As the third and final day of work came to a close, the pressure to get everything completed and
                    working for the final presentation was rising. A clumsy mistake meant one of the 5V power supplies
                    got shorted out, killing the Teensy, which meant none of the LEDs, solenoids or motors controllers
                    could be operated. With just minutes to spare, we decided to at least get the marble run working, by
                    hooking up the turbines geared DC brushed motors to a buck regulator - even if there wasn’t going to
                    be any pretty lighting effects or solenoid action.

                    Our time to present came along, and thankfully, whilst we were explaining our design process and
                    team roles to the panel of judges and other teams, the marble run continued to operate flawlessly in
                    the background, albeit a little loud.

                    Whilst we didn’t win the challenge, the event was a fantastic opportunity to develop friendships,
                    network with other students and Siemens graduates, and learn some new skills. Furthermore, I was
                    personally offered a 12-week internship with Siemens as result of the competition.

                    Later on in the year, the iForge wanted to put our marble run on display. This gave us the chance to
                    re-design some aspects of the elevator mechanism and track. We spent several hours designing and
                    manufacturing new parts of the marble run, and enclosed the entire thing in a clear acrylic
                    container so that people can operate it whilst on display.
