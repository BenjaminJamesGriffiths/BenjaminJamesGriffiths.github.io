                    Using my experience developing an Android application with Bluetooth connectivity for project
                    Moonworks, I designed a similar application in Android Studio, but for controlling my robot arm.
                    This enabled me to remotely control the robot arm without relying on a computer running a g-code
                    generator being plugged in all the time. It was also quite amusing to hide with the app connected
                    and randomly move the arm as people walked nearby.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">

                    The application had two interfaces, with the first containing all the main arm controls such as
                    forward/backward, up/down, left/right and base rotation, as well has controls for the end effector
                    servo motors. The current position of the robot arm is displayed at the top of the interface, and a
                    convenient toggle switch control the speed the arm moves. A single press of the control buttons will
                    move that axes 1mm, whereas holding down the buttons will increase/decrease the axes coordinates at
                    a linear speed depending on the toggle switch position. The home button will immediately return the
                    arm to its starting position.

            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    The second interface can be accessed using the button at the bottom of the screen, which contains
                    controls to record the arms position at multiple positions and playback the movement sequence. The
                    user simply uses the first interface to manoeuvre the arm to its desired position, then switches to
                    the second interface to hit the record button, which will add the current position to a list. The
                    positions on the list can be sequentially played back by hitting the play button.

                    To send g-code commands to GRBL, I made a circuit on vero board that contained 3x DRV8825 stepper
                    drivers, a buck regulator to provide the correct voltage for the servo motors, a HC-05 Bluetooth
                    module with a 3.3V-5V level shifter, and two Arduino Nanos. The first Arduino Nano handled the
                    communication with the Android application, generated the signals to control the servo motors, and
                    generated g-code commands to send to the second Arduino Nano, which was running GRBL. While it seems
                    silly to use two Arduino Nanos, GRBL requires almost all of the Arduino’s memory, and you can’t have
                    extra code running alongside GRBL as it would mess with the timers used to generate the high
                    frequency pulses for the stepper drivers.

                    An advantage of using the first Arduino Nano to generate the g-code commands is that it could
                    perform reverse kinematics. This is the process of defining the positional co-ordinates for the end
                    effector, and then calculating the angles of each axis to get to that position. For example, in
                    relation to the application, when the user holds down the forward or reverse button, the inverse
                    kinematic equations will calculate the angle of each arm section to move the end effector straight
                    in that direction. Without this, the user would have to move each arm section bit by bit to get the
                    end effector to move left or right in a straight line etc.

                    The application sends serial commands to the HC-5 Bluetooth receiver in the format shown above, The
                    first digit represents a manual movement, with the second digit representing a recorded movement,
                    followed by the X, Y and Z positional co-ordinates, and lastly the angular position of the end
                    effectors rotation and gripper servo motors. This is transmitted from the application as a 20 character long
                    serial command to the first Arduino, which break apart the command into its different components, so
                    it can update the servo position signals, and run the positional coordinates through the reverse
                    kinematic equations to calculate the required angle of each arm joint. Lastly, the appropriate
                    g-code string is formed, which is sent via serial to the second Arduino running GRBL to rotate the
                    arms stepper motors.
