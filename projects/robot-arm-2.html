                    Whilst my <a href="robot-arm.html" target="_self">first design</a> of a desktop robot arm was a
                    success, there were a few problems and design
                    flaws that I wanted address in the 2nd design revision.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">

            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    Firstly, the base rotation mechanism, which used a standard NEMA 17 stepper motor with a 3.75:1
                    reduction belt and pulley gearing system, would often skip steps when performing fast movements, and
                    was prone to stalling. This mechanism was replaced with a 27:1 planetary geared NEMA 17 motor,
                    similar in design to the 50:1 planetary geared motor used for lower and upper arm sections.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    Whilst the 50:1 gear ratio was excellent at amplifying the torque from the NEMA 17 motors to a
                    usable level, it came with a significant speed reduction. The base rotation did not have nearly the
                    same torque requirements of the main arm sections, so a lower gear ratio was chosen to achieve a
                    higher speed of rotation.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">

            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    The second problem with the design was the rods used to form the parallelogram, responsible for
                    rotation the upper arm section and keeping the end effector perfectly level, irrespective of its
                    position within the arms available reach. The shape of these rode was initially designed for
                    clearance reasons, however, when under tension, they tended to deform. This was fixed in the new
                    design by using thicker, straight rods.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img class="project-image image-medium" src="../assets/images/robot-arm-v2/robot-arm-1-rod.png">

            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    The third problem was the available reach the arm could achieve, which was limited by the threaded
                    spacers used to connect the lower and upper arm section panels together. The upper arm section and
                    rods would collide with these threaded spacers when moved to extreme angles. This was fixed in the
                    new design by placing the threaded spacers in less conflicting locations, expanding the available
                    reach of the arm significantly.

            <div class="image-container">

                <p>
                    The fourth problem with the original design was the way the side panels that mount the main motors
                    were attached to the base plate. They were attached using laser cut tabs and Cyanoacrylate adhesive,
                    which by no means made a weak connection, it just meant I couldn’t easily access certain areas of
                    the arm such as the motor mounting bolts, without having the take the entire arm apart.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    This was fixed in the new design by replacing the tab and glue approach with two short pieces of
                    aluminium extrusion that act as sturdy right-angle brackets. Each side panel was bolted to the
                    aluminium extrusion, making assembly/disassembly far simpler.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">

            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    The fifth problem was the end effector rotation, where the actual rotating part was only attached to
                    the arm via servo shaft, which is supported only by small bushing, resulting in significant wobble.
                    In the new design, I redesigned the end effector to incorporate a thrust bearing and a dedicated
                    shaft to increase the stiffness of the whole assembly, and make it more resilient to moment forces.

            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    The sixth problem was the mounting hubs used to connect the arm sections to the motor shafts. In the
                    original design, aluminium mounting hubs with M3 mounting holes were used, which are secured to the
                    motor shaft via a tiny grub screw. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that these mounting hubs were not
                    at all suitable for the torque required to lift payloads at large distances. I found myself
                    constantly tightening up the grub screw, to the point where the threads became stripped, and the
                    grub screw ruined the flat section of the motors D-shaped shaft, which was made with quite a soft
                    steel.

            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    This was fixed in the new design by using clamp style mounting hubs, typically used to secure linear
                    rails on 3-D printers and other devices. I couldn’t find any D-shape mounting hubs that would fit
                    the motor shaft size, but a regular 8mm circular clamping mounting hub worked perfectly, never
                    slipped, and even allows the motors to be back driven without inflicting damage.

            <div class="image-container">

            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    The final problem was the arms unawareness of its position. In the original design, I had to
                    manually jog the arm to its home position and enter the home command on the control software every
                    time the arm was powered on. Which was both tedious and prevented any basic form of repeatability,
                    as I was jogging the arm to it’s home position by eye.

            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    This has been fixed in the new design with limit switches mounted on the axes that contains stepper
                    motors. The homing command in GRBL (CNC control software) can be called when the arm is powered on,
                    which individually moves each axis until the limit switch is activated. This allows the arm to
                    repeat movements perfectly, no matter the position of the arm when it’s powered on. It’s not closed
                    loop control by any means, which would be ideal and requires expensive optical encoders, but it’s
                    certainly an improvement.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    Overall, the design of the arm was greatly improved, and I managed to get most of it manufactured,
                    but ultimately never got round to putting it all together as university work started to pile up.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>
                    I also wanted to mount the electronics onto the arm itself, eliminating the mess of cables that were
                    present in the original design. I designed a custom PCB, that contained two ATmega 328p’s just like
                    the previous circuit design, with one running the GRBL software, and the other handling the commands
                    from the control program and controlling the servo motors. The stepper driver of choice was the
                    Trinamic TMC2209, which includes their “StealthChop” technology, providing much quieter stepper
                    motor operation. The board contained a USB socket to send serial commands via an FT232RL USB to
                    serial UART interface, and a MAX12931 digital signal isolator for protection. A +5V switching
                    regulator was used to power the logic devices on the board from the +24V supply voltage. JST
                    XH-series connectors were used to connect the stepper motors, servos, and limit switches to the
                    board. Additionally, two VNH7070 full-bridges were included in-case I wanted to power brushed motors
                    in the future.

                    Due to university commitments, I never got round to sending the board off for manufacture, but it
                    was a worthwhile project, and was a good opportunity to gain more experience using Ki-CAD and
                    Autodesk Fusion 360.
